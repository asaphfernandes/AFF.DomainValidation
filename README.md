# AFF.DomainValidation

This is a simple library cross cutting to DDD. But you can use to anything project.

The main idea of that library is to create a concept and a standart of implementation for treatment of the message. Since we have a class of the validate data, that is same class can to use for validate other many interation moments  of the same data.

See the example project which is in console. In it weâ€™ll find a person entity (EntityPerson), a service class (ServicePerson) for to manage the CRUD and a other class for data validation (ValidationPerson). In the validation class we have the main validate, the method Validate. But is possible add other methods of validation to the person entity, such as example, DeleteValidation, that will possibility validate of delete the chosen registry.

When all messages are centralized in the class, that is facilitates control of show for any project that is under developement. And based on the status pattern, the control how message will are displayed becomes easier.

Download the example project and see better the implementation of the Validation.
